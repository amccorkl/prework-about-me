						Boo the dog belongs to a San Francisco-based Facebook employee who created a Facebook page for the dog with a statement "My name is Boo. I am a dog. Life is good." He became popular in October 2010 after singer Ke$ha sent a tweet that she had a new boyfriend, linking to the page.
						Chronicle Books, noticing that Boo had 5 million Facebook fans at the time, approached the owner to write a picture book. 
					</p>
					<p> 
						<!--italicized the books' title--> 
						In August 2011, <em>The Life of the World's Cutest Dog</em>, written by his owner under pen name J.H. Lee, was published. The book was eventually published in ten languages. A second book followed, <em>Boo: Little Dog in the Big City</em>, as well as a calendar and plans for a cut-out book and additional children's books. 
					</p>
					<p> 
						He also has his own stuffed animal for kids. His merchandise includes a Gund stuffed animal.
					</p>
					<p>
						Boo was appointed a spokesdog for Virgin America airline, which featured photos of him in an airplane along with advice for people traveling with pets. In April 2012, Boo was the subject of a death hoax after #RIPBOO appeared on Facebook. Tweets followed as Gizmodo writer Sam Biddle tweeted Boo had died. It was later confirmed by The Chronicle Book staff that Boo was alive and well. In July 2012, Boo was named the Official Pet Liaison of Virgin America.
