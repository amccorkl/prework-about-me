    <!-- Change text color --must use a different "word" for each id-->
    <p id="red">This text is red.</p>
    <p id="blue">This text is blue.</p>
    <p id="green">This text is green.</p>

    <!-- Change font-size, best to use id words that signify what I'm doing -->
    <p id="big">This text is BIG!</p>
    <p id="tiny">This text is tiny...</p>

    <!-- Center -->
    <p id="centered">~~This text is centered~~</p>

    <!-- Bold -->
    <p id="bold">If we have something important to say, we can make it bold!</p>

    <!-- Change font -->
    <p id="arial">We can even change our font-family if we are feeling creative!</p>

    <!-- Multiple attributes -->
    <p id="larger">Try combining multiple attributes to make big, orange, bold text!</p>

    <!-- Classes, .styledFont is the id and then the word I'll use in my style.css file -->
    <p class="styledFont">We can also apply the same style to multiple HTML elements.</p>
    <p class="styledFont">Each one of these lines is within a different &ltp&gt tag, yet they all have the same styling.</p>
    <p class="styledFont">That's because they are all a part of the same CSS class!</p>
    <p class="styledFont">CSS classes let us define a style once and let us then apply it to multiple elements!</p>
    <p class="styledFont">In your external CSS file, create a style for the class styledFont.</p>
    <p class="styledFont">Notice how every time you change the class styledFont, all of the text changes.</p>

    <p>Just as classes can be used to style multiple elements, id's are used to style single, unique elements. Give the following image a border by adding style attributes to your external CSS file. (Hint: Remember to include a border width, style, and color.)</p>

    <!-- Border & id, needed to change the jpg to png as jpg wasn't found, plus I think the png is supposed to be used for icons -->
